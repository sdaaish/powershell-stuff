Various powershellscripts.

** Create a Powershell profile
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: create-a-powershell-profile
    :END:

Check if you have a Powershell profile with =Test-Path $profile=. If you
don't have that, the output is false, initialise the file with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    New-Item -type file -force $profile
    notepad $profile
#+END_EXAMPLE

Content of that file should be:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $DirScripts = "$env:Userprofile\Repos\powershell-stuff"
    . "$DirScripts\profile.ps1"
#+END_EXAMPLE
if you have your files in ~Repos/Powershell~ in your home-directory.
** Themes
There are different tools to chosse from regarding to colorthemes.
- Colortool
- concfg
- PSConSoleTheme
- Base16
- And manually changing color with powershell.

I'm using different methods at the moment, a bit indecisive.
